master branch
-------------
This is the default branch.
This is the first branch that everyone sees when they visit the project repository.
This will contain the most recently released version of the working tested parts along with relevant documentation for this specific version. 

develop branch
--------------
This is a staging branch for the master branch.
Assume that the develop branch may be merged into the master branch at anytime.
Do all actual work in a new branch from the develop branch and then clean it up before merging it back into the develop branch.
