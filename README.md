## Specifications
The 3mL Syringe Micropipette can dispense up to 1.1mL of liquid. It can be adjusted to any value between 0.0mL to 1.1mL.

When the plunger is fully depressed into its lock position the syringe reads 0.7mL. 

When the plunger is released and the screw at its lowest value reads 0.7mL.

When the plunger is released and the screw at its highest value reads 1.8mL.

Thus this micropipette can dispense amounts as low as 0.0mL and amounts as high as 1.1mL. Any value in between can be adjusted to 0.1mL.
