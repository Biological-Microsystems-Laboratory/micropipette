User-Guide
1.	Attach the syringe to the pipette housing
	a. remove the syringe plunger and place a spring into the 	syringe
	b. replace the syringe plunger back onto the syringe
	c. then place the wings of the syringe against the bottom 		face of the body and twist until the syringe is secured.
2.	Push the micropipettes plunger until it is locked.
3.	Place a tip at the end of the syringe
4.	Record the value of the syringe form where the syringe 	 	plunger is in contact with the spring (this will be the 	initial value in uL)
5.	Add the value you want dispense to the initial value (this   	will be the "adjusted value")
6.	release the pipette plunger and adjust the screw until 	your syringe reads 50uL above the "adjusted value"
7.	Then place the tip inside the solution you want to measure 	and press the release to release the plunger
8.	Then push the pipettes plunger all the way down to 	dispense all the liquid back into the solution.
9.	Repeat this steps 7-8 two more times (this is called pre-	wetting )
10.	Then make sure your plunger is in the released position.
11.	Adjust the screw so that your syringe reads the adjusted 	value from step 3
12.	Place your tip inside the liquid you want to measure and 	press the release button
