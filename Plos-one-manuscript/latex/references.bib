abstract = {Understanding basic concepts of electronics and computer programming allows researchers to get the most out of the equipment found in their laboratories. Although a number of platforms have been specifically designed for the general public and are supported by a vast array of on-line tutorials, this subject is not normally included in university chemistry curricula. Aiming to provide the basic concepts of hardware and software, this article is focused on the design and use of a simple module to control a series of PDMS-based valves. The module is based on a low-cost microprocessor (Teensy) and open-source software (Arduino). The microvalves were fabricated using thin sheets of PDMS and patterned using CO2 laser engraving, providing a simple and efficient way to fabricate devices without the traditional photolithographic process or facilities. Synchronization of valve control enabled the development of two simple devices to perform injection (1.6 Â± 0.4 $\mu$L/stroke) and mixing of different solutions. Furthermore, a practical demonstration of the utility of this system for microscale chemical sample handling and analysis was achieved performing an on-chip acid-base titration, followed by conductivity detection with an open-source low-cost detection system. Overall, the system provided a very reproducible (98{\%}) platform to perform fluid delivery at the microfluidic scale.},

abstract = {Most electroanalytical techniques require the precise control of the potentials in an electrochemical cell using a potentiostat. Commercial potentiostats function as "black boxes," giving limited information about their circuitry and behaviour which can make development of new measurement techniques and integration with other instruments challenging. Recently, a number of lab-built potentiostats have emerged with various design goals including low manufacturing cost and field-portability, but notably lacking is an accessible potentiostat designed for general lab use, focusing on measurement quality combined with ease of use and versatility. To fill this gap, we introduce DStat (http://microfluidics.utoronto.ca/dstat), an open-source, general-purpose potentiostat for use alone or integrated with other instruments. DStat offers picoampere current measurement capabilities, a compact USB-powered design, and user-friendly cross-platform software. DStat is easy and inexpensive to build, may be modified freely, and achieves good performance at low current levels not accessible to other lab-built instruments. In head-to-head tests, DStat's voltammetric measurements are much more sensitive than those of "CheapStat" (a popular open-source potentiostat described previously), and are comparable to those of a compact commercial "black box" potentiostat. Likewise, in head-to-head tests, DStat's potentiometric precision is similar to that of a commercial pH meter. Most importantly, the versatility of DStat was demonstrated through integration with the open-source DropBot digital microfluidics platform. In sum, we propose that DStat is a valuable contribution to the "open source" movement in analytical science, which is allowing users to adapt their tools to their experiments rather than alter their experiments to be compatible with their tools.},

To increase the range and versatility of reactionware devices, sealed, monolithic reactors suitable for use in hydrothermal synthesis have been digitally designed and realized. The fabrication process allows the introduction of reaction mixtures directly into the reactors during the production, and also enables the manufacture of devices of varying scales and geometries unavailable in traditional equipment. The utility of these devices is shown by the use of 3D printed, high-throughput array reactors to discover two new coordination polymers, optimize the synthesis of one of these, and scale-up its synthesis using larger reactors produced on the same 3D printer. Reactors were also used to produce phase-pure samples of coordination polymers MIL-96 and HKUST-1, in yields comparable to synthesis in traditional apparatus.},

Two of the best-known explanations for such cooperation are direct reciprocity, in which cooperation evolves as a conditional strategy over repeated interactions, and population structuring, in which cooperators associate disproportionately with cooperators. However, many systems have the potential to generate cooperation through both of these routes; for example, common murres regularly preen both their mates and close colony neighbors over repeated interactions. How might these routes to cooperation interact? In a recent paper, van Veelen et al. consider this question in a systematic way. Their answer is unexpected.},

An attractive, but unexplored, application is to use a 3D printer to initiate chemical reactions by printing the reagents directly into a 3D reactionware matrix, and so put reactionware design, construction and operation under digital control. Here, using a low-cost 3D printer and open-source design software we produced reactionware for organic and inorganic synthesis, which included printed-in catalysts and other architectures with printed-in components for electrochemical and spectroscopic analysis. This enabled reactions to be monitored in situ so that different reactionware architectures could be screened for their efficacy for a given process, with a digital feedback mechanism for device optimization. Furthermore, solely by modifying reactionware architecture, reaction outcomes can be altered. Taken together, this approach constitutes a relatively cheap, automated and reconfigurable chemical discovery platform that makes techniques from chemical engineering accessible to typical synthetic laboratories.},

abstract = {Rapid prototyping (RP) is a useful method for designing and fabricating a wide variety of devices used for neuroscience research. The present study confirms the utility of using fused deposition modeling, a specific form of RP, to produce three devices commonly used for basic science experimentation. The accuracy and precision of the RP method varies according to the type and quality of the printer as well as the thermoplastic substrate. The printer was capable of creating device channels with a minimum diameter of 0.4 or 0.6 mm depending on the orientation of fabrication. RP enabled the computer-aided design and fabrication of three custom devices including a cortical recording/stroke induction platform capable of monitoring electrophysiological function during ischemic challenge. In addition to the recording platform, two perfusion chambers and a cranial window device were replicated with sub-millimeter precision. The ability to repeatedly modify the design of each device with minimal effort and low turn-around time is helpful for oft-unpredictable experimental conditions. Results obtained from validation studies using both the cortical recording platform and perfusion chamber did not vary from previous results using traditional hand-fabricated or commercially available devices. Combined with computer-aided design, rapid prototyping is an excellent alternative for developing and fabricating custom devices for neuroscience research. ?? 2008.},

abstract = {Just as the power of the open-source design paradigm has driven down the cost of software to the point that it is accessible to most people, the rise of open-source hardware is poised to drive down the cost of doing experimental science to expand access to everyone. To assist in this aim, this paper introduces a library of open-source 3-D-printable optics components. This library operates as a flexible, low-cost public-domain tool set for developing both research and teaching optics hardware. First, the use of parametric open-source designs using an open-source computer aided design package is described to customize the optics hardware for any application. Second, details are provided on the use of open-source 3-D printers (additive layer manufacturing) to fabricate the primary mechanical components, which are then combined to construct complex optics-related devices. Third, the use of the open-source electronics prototyping platform are illustrated as control for optical experimental apparatuses. This study demonstrates an open-source optical library, which significantly reduces the costs associated with much optical equipment, while also enabling relatively easily adapted customizable designs. The cost reductions in general are over 97{\%}, with some components representing only 1{\%} of the current commercial investment for optical products of similar function. The results of this study make its clear that this method of scientific hardware development enables a much broader audience to participate in optical experimentation both as research and teaching platforms than previous proprietary methods.},
