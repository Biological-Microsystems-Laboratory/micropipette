abstract = {Microfluidicsisanevolving scientificfieldwith immense commercialpotential:analyticalapplications,suchas biochemical assay development, biochemical analysis and biosensors as well as chemical synthesis applications essentially requiremicrofluidics for sample handling, treatment or readout.Anumber of techniquesare available tocreatemicrofluidic structures today.Onindustrial scale replication techniquessuch as injectionmolding are thegold standardwhereasacademicresearchmostly focusesonreplicationbycasting of soft elastomers such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Both of these techniques require the creation of a replicationmaster thus creating the microfluidic structure only in the second process step—they can therefore be termed two-(ormulti-)stepmanufacturing techniques. However, very often the number of pieces tobecreatedofonespecificmicrofluidicdesign is low, sometimes evenas lowas one.This raises thequestion if two-step manufacturing is an appropriate choice, particularly if short concept-to-chip times are required. In this case one-step manufacturing techniques that allow the direct creation ofmicrofluidic structures from digital three-dimensionalmodels are preferable. For these processes the number of parts per design is low (sometimes as low as one), but quick adaptation is possible by simply changing digital data. Suitable techniques include, among others,maskless ormask based stereolithography, fused depositionmolding and 3D printing. This work intends to discuss the potential and application examples of such processes with a detailed view on applicablematerials. It will also point out the advantages and the disadvantages of the respective technique. Furthermore this paper also includes a discussion about non-conventional manufacturing equipment andcommunityprojects that canbeusedinthe productionofmicrofluidicdevices},

abstract = {Just as the power of the open-source design paradigm has driven down the cost of software to the point that it is accessible to most people, the rise of open-source hardware is poised to drive down the cost of doing experimental science to expand access to everyone. To assist in this aim, this paper introduces a library of open-source 3-D-printable optics components. This library operates as a flexible, low-cost public-domain tool set for developing both research and teaching optics hardware. First, the use of parametric open-source designs using an open-source computer aided design package is described to customize the optics hardware for any application. Second, details are provided on the use of open-source 3-D printers (additive layer manufacturing) to fabricate the primary mechanical components, which are then combined to construct complex optics-related devices. Third, the use of the open-source electronics prototyping platform are illustrated as control for optical experimental apparatuses. This study demonstrates an open-source optical library, which significantly reduces the costs associated with much optical equipment, while also enabling relatively easily adapted customizable designs. The cost reductions in general are over 97\%, with some components representing only 1\% of the current commercial investment for optical products of similar function. The results of this study make its clear that this method of scientific hardware development enables a much broader audience to participate in optical experimentation both as research and teaching platforms than previous proprietary methods.},
