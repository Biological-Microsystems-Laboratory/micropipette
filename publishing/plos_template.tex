% Once your paper is accepted for publication and enters production, 
% PLEASE REMOVE ALL TRACKED CHANGES in this file and leave only
% the final text of your manuscript.
%
% DO NOT ADD EXTRA PACKAGES TO THIS TEMPLATE unless absolutely necessary.
% Packages included in this template are intentionally

% -- FIGURES AND TABLES
%
% DO NOT INCLUDE GRAPHICS IN YOUR MANUSCRIPT
% - Figures should be uploaded separately from your manuscript file. 
% - Figures generated using LaTeX should be extracted and removed from the PDF before submission. 
% - Figures containing multiple panels/subfigures must be combined into one image file before submission.
% See http://www.plosone.org/static/figureGuidelines for PLOS figure guidelines.
%
% Tables should be cell-based and may not contain:
% - tabs/spacing/line breaks within cells to alter layout
% - vertically-merged cells (no tabular environments within tabular environments, do not use \multirow)
% - colors, shading, or graphic objects
% See http://www.plosone.org/static/figureGuidelines#tables for table guidelines.
%
% For sideways tables, use the {rotating} package and use \begin{sidewaystable} instead of \begin{table} in the appropriate section. PLOS guidelines do not accomodate sideways figures.

% -- EQUATIONS, MATH SYMBOLS, SUBSCRIPTS, AND SUPERSCRIPTS
%
% IMPORTANT
% Below are a few tips to help format your equations and other special characters according to our specifications. For more tips to help reduce the possibility of formatting errors during conversion, please see our LaTeX guidelines at http://www.plosone.org/static/latexGuidelines
%
% Please be sure to include all portions of an equation in the math environment, and for any superscripts or subscripts also include the base number/text. For example, use $mathrm{mm}^2$ instead of mm$^2$ (do not use \textsuperscript command).
%
% DO NOT USE the \rm command to render mathmode characters in roman font, instead use $\mathrm{}$
% For bolding characters in mathmode, please use $\mathbf{}$ 
%
% Please add line breaks to long equations when possible in order to fit our 2-column layout. 
%
% For inline equations, please do not include punctuation within the math environment unless this is part of the equation.
%
% For spaces within the math environment please use the \; or \: commands, even within \text{} (do not use smaller spacing as this does not convert well).

\section*{Introduction}

3D printing as a form of additive manufacturing has existed for decades althought the recent avalibilty of inexpensive desktop printers have made it feasible for consumers to design and print prototypes and even functional parts, and consumer goods.

The open source software movement and has spawned the additional areas of open source hardware, such as microcontroller boards (Arduino) as well as 3D printers themselves (RepRap).
Open source scientific instruments and laboratory equipment are being actively developed(openpcr.org, opensource lab book.)
3D-printable lab equipment is and an attractive idea because of the simplicity of downloading and printing a functional object for only the price of the raw material. 
In addition, end users can customize the equiment to their application. 
Some of the more clever printable parts that have emerged are ones that give a new function to a ubiquitous existing device.
For example a drill bit attachment was designed and printed to hold micro centrifuge tubes allowing a drill to be used for centrifuging samples. 
Although this may make a rather crude centrifuge it may be and adequate method that only costs pennies compared to commercially available centrifuges and could allow researchers in the developing world to better participate in science by reducing some finacial barriers of entry.

Printable micropipette designs can be found on 3D-part sharing websites (thiniverse).
While existing designs may require only pen springs, a gasket made from a balloon, and tape, none allow adjustment to know volumes nor have any been rigorously validated.
We present a pipette constructed from 3D printed parts that allows a 1 mL syringe to be actuated to an adjustable volume.
The scale marks on the syringe can be used to adjust the dispensed volume accurately without calibrating with a scale.



This is a test of the citations \cite{oppegard2010}.
