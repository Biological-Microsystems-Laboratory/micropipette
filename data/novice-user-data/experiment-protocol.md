Experimental Description:
To test the reliability and validity of the pipettes, the pipettes will be tested with 10 test subjects. Each 
subject will be provided with a set of instructions (attached below). Each subject will dispense 10uL, 
20uL, 50uL, and 200uL of water onto a weigh boat. The users will adjust the value of the pipette using 
just their eyes. They will subtract the initial value from the adjusted value. These steps are included in 
the user protocol. They will perform 3 trials for each measurement. They will weigh each trial 
themselves and will be informed of the weight. They will also be allowed to readjust the screw after 
each trial if needed. The 3 trials at the 4 different measurements by 10 subjects allows us to 
demonstrate the ease of use, accuracy, and precision of the pipette.
