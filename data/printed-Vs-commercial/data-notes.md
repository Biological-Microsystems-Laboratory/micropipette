Data notes printed pipette
---

* rows are multiple measurements without adjusting the pipette
* columns are trials where the pipette was adjusted from a different value
* Values are mass in grams of water dispensed onto the scale

commercial pipette
----
* rows are measurements without readjusting or changing the pipette
* columns are 200, 50 and 20 uL

comparison of accuracy and precision of the printed pipette with the commercial pipette
----

Three volumes were selected: 200, 50, and 20 uL,  spanning the range of 3 commercial pipettes. The printed pipette was set by eye to each volume and 5 measurements were taken (4 significant figures) and averaged. Three separate trails were taken and averaged for each volume. The precision is expressed as the standard deviation of the sample. 

Ten measurements at each volume were taken for the commercial pipette with the precision expressed the same way.    

The values are converted to micrograms from grams and the significant figures are applied to the tens place.
