#Data taking procedure:

##Day before

Set up the scale on a vibration isolated table (optics air-table).

Place a 50 mL cup of deionized water and a thermometer near the scale the day before to equilibrate to room temperature.

##Day of data recording:

**Preform evaporation loss procedure for 10 and 20 uL:** To determine mass loss, dispense water into the weighing vessel, note the reading and begin timing with a stop watch. Check how much the reading decreases during 30 seconds. Compare this to the pipetting. Typically, the pipetting time might be 10 seconds and the mass loss is2 mg.
Record the water and room temperature as well as the relative humidity.
*note: All pipetting/dispensing should be done with the pipette completely vertical.*
##Commercial Pipette

**With ependorf research 200 uL pipette:**

1. Set to 200
2. pre-wet
3. pipette and record 5 times
4. set to 50 
5. repeat 
6. set to 20
7. repeat 2-3
8. get a new tip, repeat 1-7
9. get a new tip, repeat 1-7


**With an ependorf research 20:**

1. Set to 10
2. pre-wet
3. pipette and record 5 times
4. get a new tip, repeat 1-3
5. get a new tip, repeat 1-3

Data will be 3 trials (N=3) at each volume with 5 measurements.


##Printed Pipette

**Person pipetting shall not see the scale read-out.**

1. set to 200
2. pre-wet
3. pipette and record 5 times
4. set to 50
5. repeat 2-3
6. set to 20
7. repeat 2-3
8. put on 20 uL pipette
9. set to 10 uL
10. repeat 2-3
11. put on a new 200 uL tip and repeat 1-10
12. put on a new 200 uL tip and repeat 1-10 (Maybe switch to another user)

Each user will complete steps 1-12, giving an n=3 for each user.
