comparison of accuracy and precision of the printed pipette with the commercial pipette
----

Three volumes were selected: 200, 50, and 20 uL,  spaning the range of 3 commerical pipettes. The printed pipette was set by eye to each volume and 5 measurements were taken (4 sigfigs) and averaged. Three seperate trails were taken and averaged for each volume. The precision is expressed as the standard deviation of the sample. 

Ten measurements at each volume were taken for the commericial pipette with the precision expressed the same way.    

On the second sheet the values are converted to uL from L and the sig figs are applied to the tens place.
